## Overview

This Etch-a-Sketch project is designed to strengthen DOM manipulation skills by creating an interactive grid of square divs. Users can draw by clicking and holding while moving the mouse over the grid. The project includes customization options like changing the grid size and adding visual effects.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** A grid of square divs is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Hover Effect:** When the user click and hold over a square, it changes color, mimicking the drawing experience.
- **Dynamic Grid Size:** A button allows users to input the number of squares per side for a new grid (up to a maximum of 100).
- **Random Colors (Optional):** Squares can be randomized in color with each interaction.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuri-italo/etch-a-sketch.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## Instructions

1. Use the default 16x16 grid to start drawing by clicking and holding over the squares.
2. To create a new grid, click the **Resize** button and enter the desired number of squares per side (maximum: 100).
3. The grid will resize accordingly while maintaining the same total space (500px wide).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript
